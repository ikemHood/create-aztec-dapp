## Create Aztec Dapp

The _"Create Aztec Dapp"_ is a scaffolding tool designed to help developers quickly bootstrap Aztec Protocol applications. It provides a streamlined way to start building decentralized applications with zero-knowledge proofs on Aztec.

The core pieces are [**React**](https://reactjs.org/), [**TypeScript**](https://typescriptlang.org/), and the [**Aztec SDK**](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages). [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) is included for styling your applications beautifully with minimal effort.

## What is Create Aztec Dapp?

Create Aztec Dapp is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool built to help developers get started with Aztec Protocol development as quickly as possible. It sets up a fully configured development environment with all the tools you need to build zero-knowledge applications.

After extensive work on the Aztec ecosystem, we've encoded our best practices and project structure into this CLI to help you avoid common pitfalls and follow proven patterns for Aztec development.

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Get started immediately without complex setup steps
- **Aztec SDK Integration**: Built-in integration with the Aztec SDK for interacting with the protocol
- **Customizable Templates**: Choose the features you need for your specific project
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and helpful error messages
- **Aztec Sandbox**: Local development environment for testing your application
- **Modern Frontend**: React with TypeScript for building robust user interfaces

## Core Principles

Create Aztec Dapp is built around several core principles:

### Privacy-First Applications

We believe in the importance of privacy in the blockchain space. Aztec Protocol enables developers to build applications that protect user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, and Create Aztec Dapp makes it easier to build those applications.

### Developer Experience

We've focused on creating a smooth developer experience, with tools and structure that make development more productive and enjoyable. This includes sensible defaults, helpful error messages, and a streamlined workflow.

### Typesafety

Type safety is a critical aspect of building robust applications. By using TypeScript throughout the stack, we help catch errors during development rather than at runtime, leading to more reliable applications.
